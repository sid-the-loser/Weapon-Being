# Weapon Being
## By SidTheloser for Pirate Software Game Jam 16

I will move all the design documents to these Google Docs once I’m done writing them.

## Advice to Pirate Software: 
I'm sorry if I may come off as being rude. 
I’m pretty sure GDDs are not the “best practice” for any game jams unless the jam is long-term, i.e., for more than a couple of weeks. 
Not everybody has a lot of free time to write and document their game in such detail that is required by a GDD. 
I understand you mean the best for the developers who are starting, but time management is another thing devs have to learn.

## Advice to other readers: 
Write it right if you’re writing a GDD! That is, manage your time and don’t rush a GDD! 
A GDD is supposed to be written in detail. Not detailing the code used in the game, but the game itself! 
Like “How should each mechanic work?” it shouldn't be about the internal workings of that mechanic, but how it should look and feel to the user 
(aka. The player, but I’m using the word user referring to the human being controlling the player character on the screen) and how it should affect the user’s gameplay.

Writing a GDD for a jam game is time-consuming, so ensure you have enough time to finish the game before you document everything. Yes, I do think for such a short time 
frame, finishing the game before you document it is a good idea!

I hope this helped. And I’m sorry if I was rude; I just had to clarify some things.
