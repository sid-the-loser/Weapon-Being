# Weapon-Being
A game I'm making for Pirate Software Game Jam 16

I joined this jam to take my engine on a test ride. This game uses an engine of mine called SidEngine, a wrapper for Pygame in one sense. It's still being worked on, so if you find any bugs, you know why lol

Here's the design document: https://github.com/sid-the-loser/Weapon-Being/blob/main/other%20files/design%20document.md

Here's the Trello board I used for my workflow: https://trello.com/b/R4fYQqeq/weapon-being
