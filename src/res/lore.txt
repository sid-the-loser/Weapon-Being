So, this is where I was supposed to be explaining the story
of the game. But I'm too tired of having to do this.

Making an engine and a game at the same time has led me to
making my first mistake. I made individual game objects to
make use of different functionalities within the game.
Turns out, if I had followed in the steps of Unity, I
would've only needed to make a couple of components that
had to be attached to an object.
